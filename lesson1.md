# ALGO-WHAT? LIVE-CODING?
from wikipedia  
Live coding, sometimes referred to as on-the-fly programming, just in time programming and conversational programming, makes programming an integral part of the running program.

The figure of live coder is who performs the act of live coding, usually "artists who want to learn to code, and coders who want to express themselves" or in terms of Wang & Cook the "programmer/performer/composer".

An [algorave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave) (from an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) and [rave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rave)) is an event where people dance to music
generated from algorithms, often using [live coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) techniques.

Alex McLean of Slub and Nick Collins coined the word "algorave" in 2011, and the first event under such a name was organised in London, UK.  
It has since become a movement, with algoraves taking place around the world.

# Guidlines

There are official [guidelines](https://github.com/Algorave/guidelines/blob/master/README_en.md) from which you are free to diverge, there is no obligation but to respect one another.

# LESDOELEN

# Lesson email digest

Thanks for joining the class today! If you were not here, read this mail and try to follow along.
Today we talked about livecoding and algorave, and about its culture, practises and
guidelines. Livecoding is a very diverse tool and is being used to create music, visuals,
choreographies, robots, ...
For this class we’re gonna focus on what we need to have music and visuals. For the
browser tools use chrome or chromium for better performance and midi interfacing.
We checked out some tools, like P5Live and Hydra for visuals, both because they are easy
to use with only a web browser and a keyboard as their requirement.
For music there is Sonic Pi and Strudel, the latter also being a web browser tool based on
tidalcycles. All the tools mentioned come with GREAT tutorials and documentation, pick one
and make yourself a bit familiar with starting the tool, creating a very basic thing and saving
it for later. Later, being next week when we will pick this up and see what you’ve come up
with for lesson2 which will be all about:
Making our first live coding piece to publish online

Happy Coding!
